# The Two Hemispheres of Lucca: Technology, Science and Human Resilience

Welcome to the **The Two Hemispheres of Lucca** repository, a project that explores the intersection between technology, science and human impact, inspired by the film *The Two Hemispheres of Lucca* (Netflix, 2025) and the book of the same name by Bárbara Anderson (2019).

This repository was created for the [DIO](https://www.dio.me/) tech community, with the goal of highlighting how technological innovations, such as the Cytotron, can transform lives and inspire technology professionals to create purposeful solutions.

## About the Project

The film, directed by Mariana Chenillo, and the book, written by Bárbara Anderson, tell the true story of a Mexican family facing the challenges of cerebral palsy in Lucca, a boy who, against all odds, achieves significant progress through an experimental treatment in India: Cytotron.

This repository organizes the content into thematic folders, covering the context of the story, the technology behind the treatment, its impact on the technology community, and references for future studies.
