# The two hemispheres of Lucca: Technology, science and human resilience

[🇧🇷](https://github.com/fzanneti/cytotron_tech_science/blob/main/README_pt.md)

Welcome to the **The Two Hemispheres of Lucca** repository, a project that explores the intersection between technology, science and human impact, inspired by the film *The Two Hemispheres of Lucca* (Netflix, 2025) and the book of the same name by Bárbara Anderson (2019).

This repository was created for the [DIO](https://www.dio.me/) tech community, with the goal of highlighting how technological innovations, such as the Cytotron, can transform lives and inspire technology professionals to create purposeful solutions.

## 🇬🇧 About the Project

Welcome to the **Os Dois Hemisférios de Lucca** repository, inspired by the film *The Two Hemispheres of Lucca* (Netflix, 2025) and the book *Los Dos Hemisferios de Lucca* (2019) by Bárbara Anderson. Created for the [DIO](https://www.dio.me/) tech community, this repository explores how technology, particularly the Cytotron, transforms lives by blending science and human resilience.  
Our goal is to inspire developers, data scientists, and engineers to create impactful solutions.

📖 **What you'll find here**:
- Context of the film, book, and real-life story.
- Technical details on the Cytotron and medical innovations.
- Lessons for the tech community and case studies.
- Resources and references for further exploration.

The film, directed by Mariana Chenillo, and the book, written by Bárbara Anderson, tell the true story of a Mexican family facing the challenges of cerebral palsy in Lucca, a boy who, against all odds, achieves significant progress through an experimental treatment in India: Cytotron.

This repository organizes the content into thematic folders, covering the context of the story, the technology behind the treatment, its impact on the technology community, and references for future studies.
