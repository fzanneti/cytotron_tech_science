# The Two Hemispheres of Lucca: Technology, Science and Human Resilience

Welcome to the **The Two Hemispheres of Lucca** repository, a project that explores the intersection between technology, science and human impact, inspired by the film *The Two Hemispheres of Lucca* (Netflix, 2025) and the book of the same name by BÃ¡rbara Anderson (2019).

This repository was created for the [DIO](https://www.dio.me/) tech community, with the goal of highlighting how technological innovations, such as the Cytotron, can transform lives and inspire technology professionals to create purposeful solutions.
